How much do the top 1 percent earn?   According to the latest data from SSA, they 
earn just under 13 percent of all earnings.   

This shiny app uses the htmltab function from the library of the same name to scrape
data off of the SSA website going back to 1990.  It then uses those data to estimate
earnings shares for six percentile ranges of earners and plots them.  The user has the
option of which percentiles to plot.  For example, the user can focus on the top decile
to see how much, if any, their share of earnings is rising or the user can focus on
the bottom half of the distribution to see how much they are loosing.
